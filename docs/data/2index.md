For every payment done using Razorpay, we levy a nominal platform fees. You can choose to charge a Convenience Fee to your customers for the use of technology infrastructure. Convenience Fees are seamlessly added at Razorpay Checkout without disrupting the checkout experience for your customers. In case a refund is initiated, your customers receive the Convenience Fees along with the actual payment amount.

# Reports

Convenience Fees reflect on all the reports in the same format as on the checkout. The charge is added to the total amount in the reports. Reports can be generated from the <a href="https://dashboard.razorpay.com" target="_blank">Razorpay Dashboard</a> under the **Reports** tab.

# Communication

You should inform the customers about the Convenience Fees. We do not notify the customer of the Convenience Fees except at checkout. In the Razorpay Payment Acknowledgement email on successful payment, the Convenience Fees are added to the total amount.

<callout warn>
**Watch Out!**

The email does not contain the payment breakup to indicate the Convenience Fees separately but is added to the total amount.
