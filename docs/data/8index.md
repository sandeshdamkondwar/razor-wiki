There are three types of credits offered by Razorpay - [Amount Credits](#amount-credits), [Fee Credits](#fee-credits) and [Refund Credits](#refund-credits). 

You can view and add funds to these credits from the Razorpay Dashboard. Also, you can [configure alerts](#credit-alerts) to receive email notifications when your credits fall below the set threshold.

# Amount Credits

Amount credits are the credits against which you can receive payments without any fee deduction. 

For example, if you have a credit of ₹100, you will not be charged any fees for payments up to ₹100. Amount credits might be assigned to your account during sign-up if Razorpay is running any promotional campaigns.

# Fee Credits

Fee credits are the credits using which businesses can receive the full settlement amount without any fee deduction. Specific business categories use these credits to help them meet regulatory requirements.

For example, if you have a fee credit of ₹100, all the transactions will be settled in full, and the fees for these payments will be deducted from the ₹100 fee credit.

# Refund Credits

Refund credits are the credits you can use to make refunds to customers. This ensures that the refunds are not made from your settlement amount but from a separate credit pool.

For example, if you have a refund credit of ₹100, any refunds to be processed will be deducted from this credit and not from the actual payment.

# Credit Alerts

You can configure alerts to receive email notifications when any of your credits fall below the set threshold amount. This will help you to monitor your credit balance and add funds to them whenever necessary.

You can set three alert levels, wherein:

- Alert Level 1: Level set by you on the Dashboard.
- Alert Level 2: Automatically set as 50% of Alert Level 1.
- Alert Level 3: Automatically set as 25% of Alert Level 1.

For example, you can set your refunds credit alert as ₹10,000. This means that whenever your refund credits balance falls below:
- ₹10,000: The first email is sent to your registered email address.
- ₹5,000: The second email is sent.
- ₹2,500: The third and final email is sent.
