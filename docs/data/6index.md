# 2-Step Verification (Account Level)

<brand-name/> provides enhanced security and protection through 2-step verification for all <brand-name/> Dashboard users.

## What is 2-Step Account Verification (Two-factor Authentication, 2FA)

To log in to the <brand-name/> Dashboard, users enter their email address and password. If the 2-step verification is enabled on an account, the user should enter a One Time Password (OTP) after the email id and password is provided. The OTP is sent to the user's registered mobile number.

You can set this additional level of security to ensure that only the intended user has access to your <brand-name/> Dashboard, thus preventing malicious attacks or misuse of your sensitive business data.
